title: CorticoNeuro 1 - Time-Specific Spike Generation
language: Wokwi
description: Information processing in the brain occurs through a sophisticated
  network of neurons that communicate using reliable electrical impulses,
  commonly known as action potentials or spikes. As a result, information is
  encoded as a sequence of events unfolding over continuous time, rather than
  relying on signal amplitude. Investigating how information is represented and
  processed as these spike trains, referred to as the neural coding problem,
  presents a significant challenge within the field of brain-inspired computing.
  Given the current emphasis on sparseness in signal processing, spike trains
  are particularly attractive. To explore the variability and the corresponding
  time stamps, this chip has implemented several test clusters featuring various
  spike trains.
